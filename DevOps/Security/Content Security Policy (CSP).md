**Content Security Policy**Â ([CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSP)) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting ([XSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting)) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft, to site defacement, to malware distribution.

### Example

A website administrator wants to allow users of a web application to include images from any origin in their own content, but to restrict audio or video media to trusted providers, and all scripts only to a specific server that hosts trusted code.

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src *; media-src example.org example.net; script-src userscripts.example.com
```
