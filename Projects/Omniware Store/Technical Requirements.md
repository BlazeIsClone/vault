All user interfaces for the static pages will be straight forward and minimal to reduce development time. The site should focus functionality and performence. Thhis will be developed on wordpress and later for scalability we will transfer to a native platform.

## Home page
Ajax products search

## Shop page
Should be able to search products using AJAX and should store filtering state in url query to persist  data while sharing and reloading.

## Create Quote Feature
Users should have the ability to create a quote and download. We should also keep a record for reference.
