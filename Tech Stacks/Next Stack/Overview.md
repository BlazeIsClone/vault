Web has been evolving from day one, from the tech we use to the experience and data we get from it. When I first got into web development the hot thing was the MERN stack. And as soon as I felt comfy writing my own HTML, CSS and JS I hopped into it. Though I was using React I was practically wasn't using any of the bread and butter formulas. I was practically using plain old JavaScript, which eventually I ran into a boat load of bugs. Then after a couple of years surfing around web development I've started to realize that how important it is to understand what a tool is and how it came to be matters.

I'm fascinated how PHP made web development straight forward for individual's to get into. How WordPress played a role in the rise of the so-called “web 2.0”. And how React popularized component based architecture and made photoshop obsolete for UI design and how Adobe XD and Figma came into our workflow where designers and developers came into a single view.

After the rise of React the client and server architecture became the go to way of building things. A backend with a REST API interface and on the client we either fetch or post data among other things. This way of thinking started forming a bigger gap where we started forming into frontend engineers and backend engineers.
