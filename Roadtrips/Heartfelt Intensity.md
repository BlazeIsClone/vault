‘Passion for the road,’ as I’ve come to understand it, is a unique mood or motivation with which one approaches being ‘on the road’ and the specific style that they bring.

And it’s a sentiment that applies very much to the work we’re doing, particularly to _how_ we build software. (Not specifically passion for the road, I promise I won’t call it that). But what there is, is a certain type of passion, virve, enthusiasm — whatever you want to call it— that each of you arrived here with and that motivates you to do what you do.

For our everyday sake, let’s call it **heartfelt intensity.**

Put most simply, heartfelt intensity is a variety of intrinsic motivation. Not the thing a person is motivated _to do_ but the drive underneath it all that makes them tick, so potent it puts a bit of magic behind the eyes.

It is often more innate than taught. Not everyone you meet has got it and that’s perfectly alright, but we look for those people in which it’s undeniable.

> _That thing_ that compels you all to obsess over the details others overlook, and do it with gusto —  _that’s_ heartfelt intensity.

 In other words, the important element here is not ‘what are you pursuing?’ Heartfelt intensity is ‘how are you pursuing it?’ — and why? Where does all that tenacity and spirit come from?

> People find joy in the work; they find joy in the details. There’s a passion for the thing itself but also for the attitude that you take on that thing.

So many of you already do this, often in the details. You leave your fingerprints behind, so that they know it was made by another person and that person cared.
