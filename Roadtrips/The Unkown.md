Whether it’s a friend or family member, we all know _that_ person. The one you love and love to be with — most of the time, but god forbid find yourself riding shotgun with them on a road trip.
Because traveling, for whatever reason, brings out the worst in them. It’s usually some combination of ‘refusal to live with ambiguity’ alongside ‘refusal to admit they’re wrong’ that makes their companionship flat out not fun.

But that's besides the point. In this style of experimentation, the point is just to start — it could be instinct, observation, a mix of both, or something else entirely that takes you on your way. 

**And that’s the liberating part, especially when it comes to our work. There are no right answers of where to go out of the gate because the real art is ‘course correcting’ along the way.**

Think about it like this: “there are no mistakes, only new paths to explore.”
