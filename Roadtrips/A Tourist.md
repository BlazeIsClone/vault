Because to travel, without at least the possibility of getting off the main drag, robs the experience of something so fundamental to turn it into something else entirely.

**It turns us into tourists, that are forever stuck in the known, the familiar, and the comfortable.**

How then — when traveling, but also in our work — do we not be ‘tourists”? How do we push past the inertia of the same, endless highways and byways via Google Maps? To know when to seek an alternative route, intellectually speaking, with both the audacity to go far and broad in our thinking, and the humility to bring back what we find there.

Create the space needed to break apart that _everydayness_ and press on it for a while. Really press on it. Go on and dream a bit. Or as Toni Morrison says it “Dream, then think.” 

And go to different places with your dreaming. Pull from elsewhere, the objective being to bring a sense of multidimensionality to what we do and how we do it.

Think about it like this: “there are no mistakes, only new paths to explore.”
