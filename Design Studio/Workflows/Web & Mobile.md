#### Discovery

To kick things off we start with a discovery session so I can learn more about your business and what you’re trying to achieve with your new website. 

#### Wireframing

I’ll create the structure for the whole site in wireframes to establish the flow of the website and how we’ll present your product or service to best achieve your goals.

#### High-fidelity designs

Next, I’ll turn these wireframes into fully polished designs. At this point you’ll be able to see what the finished website will look like.

#### Development

Once you’re completely happy with the design we'll develop, using modern frontend and backend tools.

#### Launch & training

We will deliver the website to you. Once it’s transferred We’ll then train you in how to use the site so you can easily manage it yourself.
